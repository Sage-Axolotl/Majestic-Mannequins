Makes armor stands look more like the player, with over 80 variants to choose from. Variants can be selected by renaming the armor stand in an anvil or using a name tag.

Just like normal armor stands, you'll need to a command to summon one with arms. Alternatively, I recommend one of the following:

[Armor Stand Arms (datapack)](https://modrinth.com/datapack/armor-stand-arms) Just adds arms.

[Armor Statues (datapack)](https://modrinth.com/datapack/armor-statues-datapack) Allows you to add arms and modify pose

[Armor Poser (mod)](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-poser) Allows you to add arms and modify pose, easier to use interface.

Requires [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) and [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)
